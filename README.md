## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to get your very own Instagram Clone running on your local machine:

### Prerequisites

- Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your machine. (You can check if they are installed by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in your terminal).

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/priyankasharma1603/Instagram-Clone-.git
   ```

2. **Navigate into the Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd Instagram-Clone-
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies for Backend**:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the Backend Server**:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The backend server will typically run on `http://localhost:5000` (or another port specified in your backend code).

5. **Install Dependencies for Frontend**:

   Open a new terminal window or tab, then navigate back to the project root and into the frontend directory:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

6. **Start the Frontend Development Server**:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the magic unfold! 🎉

### Additional Notes:
- **Backend Directory**: Ensure that your project structure has a clear separation of the backend and frontend directories. You can adjust the paths in the README if needed.
- **Backend Details**: If your backend requires additional setup (like environment variables, database connections, etc.), you might want to include those instructions under the backend section.
- **Frontend Details**: Similarly, if the frontend has specific configurations (like API endpoints, state management setups, etc.), you can add that information to help users.

Feel free to modify any section further to better fit your project’s specifics! If you need anything else, just let me know!
